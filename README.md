# Summarization-of-PDF-file-using-Open-AI-GPT-3-

### In this project, I have used GPT-3 to develop a PDF summarization tool. This tool can be used to quickly and easily summarize long PDF documents into shorter, more concise pieces of text. This can be useful for people who need to read and understand large amounts of information, such as students, researchers, and professionals.

### GPT-3 is a valuable tool for a number of reasons. First, it is very good at understanding and generating human language. This means that it can produce summaries that are both accurate and easy to read. Second, GPT-3 is very versatile. It can be used to summarize a wide variety of PDF documents, including research papers, news articles, and product manuals. Third, GPT-3 is easy to use. It can be accessed through a simple API, which makes it easy to integrate into existing software applications.
### This project demonstrates the potential of GPT-3 for text summarization.
